HOW TO TEST

- Open the server folder
- In the terminal, execute:
    + cd "PATH" (for ex. it is located in my desktop: "cd C:/Users/Onur/Desktop/mine-detection-drone-web")
    + npm run dev
    + now the UI is running, open a browser tab with the link "http://localhost:3000"

- To get the data from the drone, now run server, by entering the "app.py" in server's folder, and clicking the run button on the upper right, or by right clicking on the code and selecting "run Python"
